# Process High-Volume Messages from Amazon SQS

This sample project demonstrates how to use an AWS Step Functions Express Workflow to process messages or data from a high-volume event source, such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Because Express Workflows can be started at a very high rate, they are ideal for high-volume event processing or streaming data workloads.

Here are two commonly used methods to execute your state machine from an event source:

* Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to start a state machine execution whenever the event source emits an event. For more information, see [Creating a CloudWatch Events Rule That Triggers on an Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-Rule.html). 

* Map the event source to a Lambda function, and write function code to execute your state machine. The AWS Lambda function is invoked each time your event source emits an event, in turn starting a state machine execution. For more information see [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html).

This sample project uses the second method to start an execution each time the Amazon SQS queue sends a message. The state machine, which consists of a chain of Lambda functions, will then process the text message by decoding it, generating statistics, removing special characters, tokenizing and counting the number of occurrence of each word in the text passage.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/step-functions-workflows-collection
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd text-processing-sqs-express
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to build and deploy the AWS resources for the workflow as specified in the template.yaml file:
    ```
    sam build --use-container
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.
    * Accept all other defaults

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works
1. When messages are sent to the SQS queue, a lambda function that has event source mapping to the SQS queue will invoke the state machine.
1. The state machine will then invoke a lambda function that will decode the base64 string recieved from the SQS queue. The lambda function's output will be sent to the next state. 
1. The state machine will invoke a lambda function that will generate statistics based on the string input received. Statistics include text length, average word length, number of digits and number of special characters. The lambda function's output will be sent to the next state. 
1. The state machine will invoke a lambda function that will remove special characters from the string input received. The lambda function's output will be sent to the next state. 
1. Finally, the state machine will invoke a lambda function that will tokenize and count the occurance of each word in the string input received.

## Testing
1. Trigger execution of the state machine. 
* Navigate to the [Amazon SQS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs). 
* Select the queue that was created by the sample project. The name will be similar to **Example-SQSQueue-wJalrXUtnFEMI**.
* Select **Send and receieve messages** 
* On the **Send a Message** window, enter the SQS sample message provided to you by the SAM deployment process output. 
2. Check the status of the step functions execution.
* Navigate to the [Step Functions console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/sample-project-express-high-volume-sqs.html).
* Choose the state machine created by the sample project. The name will be similar to **ExpressStateMachineForTextProcessing-8g1YFCmjTjrH**.
* Navigate to the **Logging** tab and choose the name of the CloudWatch Logs log group and inspect the logs. The name of the log group will look like **example-ExpressLogGroup-wJalrXUtnFEMI**. 


## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```

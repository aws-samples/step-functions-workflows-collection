        "This example workflow illustrate practical solutions for fetching failed state name in JSONata StateMachine with common fallback state for multiple task states. AWS Step Functions users commonly seek to implement centralized error reporting within their workflows to avoid duplicating error handling logic across multiple states. While implementing a shared error reporting task is straightforward, a significant challenge arises: the error reporting task can access the error message from the failed state, but cannot inherently determine which specific state triggered the error. This limitation becomes particularly problematic in workflows containing numerous Lambda functions, as it complicates identifying the exact point of failure. Using JSONata as our query language, we demonstrate approach to overcome this limitation, enabling comprehensive error tracking while maintaining workflow efficiency."

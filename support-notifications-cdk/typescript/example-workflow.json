      "This workflow implements a notification system for when critical or urgent cases are created with AWS Support.",
      "For customers with many administrators who may be logging support cases, a manager may be interested when business critical or production systems are down. Rather than relying on the administrator to add the manager to the case, this automation sends an email notification via Amazon SNS to the manager notifying them of the new created urgent or critical case. The manager can then choose to login to the AWS Console, review the case and add themselves as an additional contact if they wish to receive further case updates.",
      "The workflow relies exclusively on AWS SDK service integrations and contains no custom Lambda code that needs to be maintained."
